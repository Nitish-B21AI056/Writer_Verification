# NCVPRIG Writer_Verification
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Github Repo is made for identifying whether a given pair of handwritten text samples was written by the same person or two different persons.
It provides a solution for identifying the authenticity of handwritten text samples, making it invaluable for real-world applications such as forensic analysis, document authentication, and signature verification systems.

# Dataset
The dataset was made available for NCVPRIG Competition. Due to terms and conditions of the competition, actual dataset can't be shared. But we encourage to use any other dataset for your project.
# Training Model
If you want to train the model from scratch, add path of your training and validation dataset in the training_model.py file.
# Inference Model
If you want to use the pre-trained model directly, simply add path of your test data in the inference.py file and you are set to use. 
# Model checkpoints
Trained models : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GY2brp7-rYLxwLa6WBMvyC_SY3cjr1Cv?usp=sharing
If you want to directly use the pre-trained model, load these model shared in the google drive to your location. Also change the path location of the model in the code accordingly.
